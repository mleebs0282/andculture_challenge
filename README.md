Goal

Build a single page application using React to display a list of breweries with the ability to click on an item from the list to view more details on that brewery.


Details

Please complete the following tasks and optional stretch goals using React JS and the OpenBreweryDB API. Feel free to use any boilerplate solutions as a starting point such as Create React App. The solution must be hosted on a public Github repository.

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS

Build a component that displays a list of breweries in a US city of your choosing.
  
	❏ The list should display the following information for each brewery
  
	❏ Name
  
	❏ Type
  
	❏ Address (Street, City, State, Zip)
  
	❏ Website URL (clickable)
  
	❏ It should pull directly from the OpenBreweryDB API and NOT be static data.

Build a component that displays the details of a brewery.
  
	❏ We ask that the detail include at least the following
		
		❏ Brewery Name
		
		❏ Address (Street, City, State, Zip)

		❏ A map indicating the brewery’s location using latitude and longitude. Feel free to use a 3rd party library like Google Map React.
		
		❏ Your app should be able to navigate back and forth between the list and brewery details components.


Apply Basic Styling to the Application

	❏ The application should have basic CSS styles applied so that the data is presented in a way that the user can digest the information, and clearly identify the navigation between the listing and detail pages.
	
	❏ There are no guidelines in terms of color scheme. That is entirely up to you.
	
	❏ Feel free to use a style framework like Bootstrap.


INTERMEDIATE REQUIREMENTS (OPTIONAL)

Meet the above requirements using the following additional technologies:

	❏ Typescript for the programming language

	❏ SASS for the styling
	
	❏ Heroku for hosting


ADVANCED REQUIREMENTS (OPTIONAL)

Build a custom back-end to retrieve the brewery from a custom REST api of your creation in place of OpenBreweryDB. The data that the API returns can be static, or can use a database technology of your choosing (e.g. MongoDB). It can be in a language and stack of your choosing, we recommend one of the following:

	❏ .NET Core / ASP.NET MVC
	
	❏ Ruby on Rails
	
	❏ Python


Code Delivery

A link to your Github repository should be sent to andculture via codechallenge@andculture.com by 11:59PM five days from the day you received the challenge. A 48 hour extension can be requested if needed to complete the tasks.
